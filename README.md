## :dart: Requirements achieved

- [x] Implemented responsive design. I made a wireframe design for mobile first, then a desktop version. I tested these with Chrome developer tools on desktops and mobile...
- [x] Implemented a media query so that the full desktop version has left and right thumbnails, the mobile version does not. I used **display:none** in CSS, I would like to know if this is 'proper' way to do this. For example, are the images still loading for a mobile, just not showing, therefore still taking up bandwidth?...
- [x] All the main images have appropriate alt text attributes for accesibility. This is done by passing in the alt description into aria-label.
- [x] Used event handlers. I wrapped the code for moving images left/right into separate functions, so that you can call that function based on either left icon click on left button click.

## :dart: Stretch goals

- [x] I am so pleased with myself that I remembered how to use the modulo operator to create an infinite loop of images - I had previously used this approach in Python to encode/decode a Caesar cipher. I had so much fun thinking about this programmatically
- [x] I used JavaScript to add an **aria-label** to each main image
- [x] Arrow keys do move images left and right. Although I cannot get these keys to work combined with using the Windows Narrator

## :pushpin: Unable to achieve

- [ ] I aimed to add a caption for each image underneath the background image. I got the JavaScript working fine, but the CSS styling became too unwieldy (having 2 rows within the same column... approaching Grid territory!) I compromised with the caption overlaying the image.
