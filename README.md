## :dart: Requirements achieved

- [x] Implemented responsive design. I made a wireframe design for mobile first, then a desktop version. I tested these with Chrome developer tools on desktops and mobile...
- [x] Implemented a media query so that the full desktop version has left and right thumbnails, the mobile version does not. I used **display:none** in CSS, I would like to know if this is 'proper' way to do this. For example, are the images still loading for a mobile, just not showing, therefore still taking up bandwidth...
- [x] All images have appropriate alt text attributes for accesibility
- [x] Used event handlers. I wrapped the code for moving images left/right into separate functions, so that you can call that function based on either left icon click on left button click.
